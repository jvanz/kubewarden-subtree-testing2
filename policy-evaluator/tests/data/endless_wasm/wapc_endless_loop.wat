;; This is a module meant to be used by a waPC host.
;;
;; This code cheats a little, from the outside it looks like any regular waPC module
;; because it exposes the two functions required by a waPC host. However, these
;; two functions are reduced to the bare minimum.
;;
;; The most important difference is that no waPC function is registered by the
;; module. Calling any kind of waPC function from the host will result in an
;; endless loop being executed.

  ;; waPC function to be invoked, nor the payload.
